<q>Valentine was a phenomenal section leader. He had a real knack for demystifying potentially confusing topics and making things feel a lot more intuitive. His sections were always so thoughtfully planned and effectively executed. He was such a friendly person to seek out for help and is a big reason I felt Econ 2110 was such a wellâ€“supported and rewarding academic experience.</q>
