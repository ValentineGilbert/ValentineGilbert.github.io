I am Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at the Harvard Kennedy School. I specialize in Urban and Public Economics and will be on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year.

My research is on urban housing affordability and focuses on understanding the geographic and distributional incidence  of changes in housing costs. In my job market paper, I use large-scale administrative data and economic theory to understand what patterns of residential mobility between housing sub-markets reveal about the price and welfare effects of building new housing.

Before my doctoral studies, I was a researcher at the University of Chicago Crime Lab and earned my B.A. in economics from the University of Rochester.
