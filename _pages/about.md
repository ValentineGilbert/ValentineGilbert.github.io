I am an applied economist and will be starting as an Assistant Professor at the University of Houston's [Hobby School of Public Affairs](https://uh.edu/hobby/) this fall.

My research is on housing affordability and the geographic and distributional consequences of changes in housing supply and costs. In my [job market paper](https://valentinegilbert.github.io/files/gilbert_jmp.pdf), I use large-scale administrative data and economic theory to understand what patterns of residential mobility between housing sub-markets reveal about the price and welfare effects of new housing construction.

I received my PhD from Harvard University. Before my doctoral studies, I was a researcher at the University of Chicago Crime Lab in New York. I received my BA in economics from the University of Rochester.
