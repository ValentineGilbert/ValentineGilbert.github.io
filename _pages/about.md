Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy (Economics Track) at the Harvard Kennedy School. I specialize in Urban and Public Economics and will be on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year.

My research is on urban housing affordability and focuses on understanding the geographic and distributional consequenes of changes in housing supply and costs. In my job market paper, I use large-scale administrative data and economic theory to understand what patterns of residential mobility between housing sub-markets reveal about the price and welfare effects of new housing construction.

Before my doctoral studies, I was a researcher at the University of Chicago Crime Lab in New York. I received my B.A. in economics from the University of Rochester.
